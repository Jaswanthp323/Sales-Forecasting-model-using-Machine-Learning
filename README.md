# Sales-Forecasting-model-using-Machine-Learning

Sales forecasting allows corporations to efficiently allocate resources including cash flow, production, and make better informed business plan. This study focuses on predicting sales for stores using a machine learning approach, specifically employing ensemble techniques with a voting mechanism.
 
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Sales prediction using machine learning involves a detailed process that starts with defining clear objectives and progresses through data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data splitting, model selection, training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring and updating.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- It is very time efficient.
- It produces good predictions that can be understood easily.
- It can handle large datasets efficiently.
- The ensemble based random forest algorithm provides a higher level of accuracy in predicting outcomes over the decision tree algorithm. 

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning, specifically ensemble techniques with a voting mechanism, to predict sales for Rossmann stores. The importance of accurate sales prediction in the retail industry, particularly for large corporations with extensive chains of businesses, cannot be overstated. Precise sales forecasts enable efficient resource allocation, optimal inventory management, and informed business planning, ultimately contributing to operational efficiency and profitability. The dataset used in this research contains key attributes such as Store, Day Of Week, Date, Sales, Customers, Open, Promo, State Holiday, and School Holiday. 

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
